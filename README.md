# TypeScript-Summernote
TypeScript definition for summernote ( http://summernote.org )

# Info
There was no TypeScript definition file for summernote yet, so I created one.
It still needs work but it allowed me already to build my TypeScript .ts files.

Summernote api is available via: http://summernote.org/deep-dive/#api

Needs more help!

# Note
I'm new to github and TypeScript so be patient, any help is welcome!
